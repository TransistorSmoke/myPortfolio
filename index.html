For this project, I worked with my cousin, Nina Cristobal of Nina Cee Studio, <a href='https://ninaceestudio.com' target='_blank'>(ninaceestudio.com)</a>, who was the main designer of this new website. We decided to port the initial design to Wordpress for easy content management. I supported by performing tests and adding additional codes specifically for site responsiveness, setup and website deployment."

The goal was to give the website a brand new feel, and most importantly, enhance its responsiveness especially to mobile devices. In the first week of October, I contacted the author and volunteered to do this project. Thankfully, he approved, and the new website went live on the first week of November 2018."

                <p>
                  My name is Jason and I am a hardware design engineer. Despite
                  this, I still have this strong interest in programming, web
                  development and graphics design. I first started with graphics
                  design sometime in 2005 as a hobby, and learned it by
                  following web tutorials. What started just a hobby turned out
                  to be a passion. I designed posters, brochures, banners, and
                  shirt designs that we used in school and family activities. As
                  for web development, I picked up the interest when I started
                  learning programming in college, and eventually when I started
                  working as an application developer and database administrator
                  later.

                <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
                <p>
                  For my first job, I worked as a software engineer from 2009
                  until 2011. I wrote and deployed
                  <strong>Powerbuilder 10</strong> applications and their
                  updates, managed databases with
                  <strong>MS SQL Server</strong> and controlled user access to
                  applications (and to source codes, for developers). But
                  eventually, I decided to try my chance in hardware
                  engineering. So from March 2011 until July 2013, I worked as a
                  hardware development engineer for automotive applications. I
                  supported hardware designers from design centers in other
                  countries, did validation tests on our products and
                  ocassionally wrote/did
                  <strong>Worse-case Circuit Analysis (WCCA)</strong>,
                  <strong>Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)</strong> and
                  <strong>
                    Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA)</strong
                  >.<br /><br />

                  Sometime in 2011 until mid-2013, while working as hardware
                  engineer, I also took some freelancing jobs at odesk.com (now
                  upwork.com) during my free time. I helped clients customize
                  their websites - which were mainly Wordpress-based, prepared
                  and sent out their newsletters in Mailchimp and designed
                  images for their businesses. However, I stopped being a
                  freelancer by the next half of 2013, once I got a new job as
                  an RF circuit design engineer. But I still continued to do web
                  and graphics design-related tasks - now as a volunteer - to
                  help family, friends and ex-clients from my freelancing days.
                  From time to time, I would receive requests for assistance
                  from them, and I was always glad to help.<br />

                <p>
                  Since I am now considering to go back to web development and
                  programming, I have been intently preparing for this venture.
                  Starting in April 2018, I have been taking courses in frontend
                  and backend development (HTML/CSS/javascript, ReactJS and
                  Angular JS, NodeJS and Python), studying and practicing almost
                  daily to establish a good skillset and refresh old skills, so
                  that I can proceed with this plan.
