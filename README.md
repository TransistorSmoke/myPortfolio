I was always interested in generally in programming, and web development. Unfortunately, having worked as a hardware engineer in the last 7 years, I was not able to get the chance to practice these interests.

Early this year (2018), I decided to devote some time to study web development. This is my first attempt to create my own website using mainly the Bootstrap framework, HTML/CSS and some Javascript, after a few months of studying and practicing web development.
